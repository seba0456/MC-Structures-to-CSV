This is a very simple mod that adds a new command to the game: `man_export_csv <pos1> <pos2>`. This command will list all block IDs, coordinates, and facing directions to a `.csv` file. Your file will be saved in \config\exported as world_name.csv.

Keep in mind that this mod may cause lag during the export process, so make sure to select reasonable dimensions for the selection zone. Make sure to not select the same coordinates, each number should be unique.

### What's the purpose of this mod? 

This mod can be used to export your world to any calculation's. I'm planning to create plugin to Unreal Engine that will allow you to import piece of Minecraft world and have it inside Unreal Engine.
